# Inspectify

![](../inspectify-screenshot.png)

## Development

Inspectify is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application for the user-interface written in TypeScript, which uses the `checko` crate compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), and finally a backend to run locally as well. Thus, it is required to have tools for all environments.

### Requirements

To build inspectify locally the following tools are required:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Install using [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just/): Install using `cargo install just` or with [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) using `cargo binstall just`.
- [Typeshare](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare): Install using `cargo install typeshare-cli` or with [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) using `cargo binstall typeshare-cli`.
- [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec): Install using `cargo install watchexec-cli` or with [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) using `cargo binstall watchexec-cli`.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): Install in the best way you see fit, but I can recommend [Volta](https://volta.sh/) on macOS and Linux, and `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS` on Windows :)

On a unix system, the following commands should get you up to speed:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall just typeshare
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
volta install node
```

### Building during development

There are two main things that must be build: The frontend UI, and inspectify the backend.

During development, you often want all the pieces to be recompiled on changes, and the `Justfile` contains what you need for this to happen. As there are two parts, it is often beneficial to run the build in three terminals.

```bash
# watch for changes in the frontend code and rebuild when needed
just watch-web

# build and serve the backend code
just watch-inspectify
```

Now the two servers should be running. On [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) you should find the frontend hosted by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that live updates on any changes. On [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) the backend is running, which shows a static version of the frontend at the time of building, but it also responds to queries about the external implementations. You should primaraly

### Building for production

Building the two components for production is automated in the `Justfile`! So all you need is to run the following command:

```bash
just build-inspectify
```
